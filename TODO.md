# Fixing Lecture Addition Error

## Current Work
Debugging and fixing the "Failed to schedule lecture" error in the admin interface when adding lectures. Root cause: Required 'subject' field not populated in DB insert due to unset in controller.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Laravel Eloquent model creation and mass assignment.
- Controller validation and data handling for Lecture model.
- Handling single vs. recurring lecture creation.
- Legacy DB field 'subject' (string name) alongside relational 'subject_id'.

## Relevant Files and Code
- **app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LectureController.php**: Main file to edit. Store method unsets 'subject' before create/insert, causing SQL error (Field 'subject' doesn't have a default value).
  - Non-recurring: unset($validated['subject']); removes it from create().
  - Recurring: $lectures[] array lacks 'subject' key.

## Problem Solving
- Logs confirmed SQL insert omits 'subject' (required, no default).
- Form sends subject name; lookup for subject_id succeeds, but legacy field needs population.
- Solution: Include 'subject' in inserts without schema changes.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- [ ] Create TODO.md (current step).
- [ ] Edit app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LectureController.php:
  - Remove unset($validated['subject']); in non-recurring path.
  - Add 'subject' => $validated['subject'] to each $lectures[] array in recurring path.
- [ ] Test: Add a single lecture via admin form; confirm success and no error in logs.
- [ ] Test recurring lecture addition.
- [ ] If successful, clear caches: php artisan view:clear && php artisan config:clear.
- [ ] Update TODO.md with completion status.
- [ ] Use attempt_completion to finalize.

Quote from recent conversation: "the error occurs because the required 'subject' field is unset before inserting into the database. The plan is to edit `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LectureController.php` to include the subject name in both single and recurring lecture creations."
